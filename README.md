The application of user-centered design practices during the implementation of this project was the aim of this project.

Agile and modern collaborative methods were used throughout the study, especially on the data gathering and planning stages.

On the other hand, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), jQuery, and Ajax were used for the front-end development.
